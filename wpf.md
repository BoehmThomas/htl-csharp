## Introduction

* Framework for building UIs for Windows
* Works for old Windows versions (e.g. Windows 7), too
* *XAML* for defining views
  * Like *HTML* being the language for web views
  * See also [XAML Standard](https://github.com/Microsoft/xaml-standard/blob/staging/docs/faq.md)
* WPF is "done"
  * Stable
  * Backwards compatible
  * No huge investments for future enhancements
